# FIX HUB (Back End)

![Fix Hub Logo](Images/fix-hub-logo-background.png)

This is an IT ticketing application, giving users the functionality to create, read, update and delete IT tickets. Within tickets, users also have the ability to create, read, update and delete comments. This idea came from my experience using applications like ServiceNow as well the functionality being in use at most companies worldwide.
